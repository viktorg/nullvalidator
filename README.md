Assess Statistical Estimates from Shotgun Proteomics Scoring Methods
===============================================
The programs helps to validate the accuracy, or calibration, of statistical scores estimated
for peptide-spectrum matches or peptides in Shotgun proteomics. 

The procedure is described in: 
"On Using Samples of Known Protein Content to Assess the
Statistical Calibration of Scores Assigned to Peptide-Spectrum Matches in Shotgun Proteomics"
by Granholm et al. Journal of Proteome Research, 2011.
