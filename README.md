Assess Statistical Estimates from Shotgun Proteomics Scoring Methods
-----------------------------------------------
The programs helps to validate the accuracy, or calibration, of statistical scores estimated for peptide-spectrum matches or peptides in Shotgun proteomics. The procedure, called the semi-labelled calibration test, is described in:  "On Using Samples of Known Protein Content to Assess the Statistical Calibration of Scores Assigned to Peptide-Spectrum Matches in Shotgun Proteomics" by Granholm et al. Journal of Proteome Research, 2011.
Workflow:
- Get MS/MS data from a sample of known protein content.
